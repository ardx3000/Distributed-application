# Distributed application
 Distributed application with a database.

 Arhitecure type: client-server

## Server:
### Functional Requirements:
-[]Ability to handle multiple client connections simultaneously.
-[]CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database.
-[]Authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the database.
-[]Transaction management to ensure data integrity during concurrent operations.
-[]Support for distributed transactions if needed.
-[]Logging and monitoring functionalities to track server performance and errors.
-[]Backup and recovery mechanisms to prevent data loss.
-[]Support for distributed caching to improve performance.

### Non-functional Requirements:
-[]Performance: Ensure low latency and high throughput for database operations.
-[]Reliability: Minimize downtime and ensure data consistency.
-[]Security: Implement encryption, secure authentication, and access controls to protect data.
-[]Scalability: Design the server to scale horizontally and vertically based on demand.
-[]Maintainability: Ensure codebase is well-documented, modular, and easy to maintain.
-[]Compatibility: Support different operating systems and platforms.
-[]Compliance: Adhere to relevant regulations and standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
-[]Resource Utilization: Optimize resource usage to minimize costs and maximize efficiency.

## Client:
### Functional Requirements:

-[]Ability to connect to the server securely.
-[]Perform CRUD operations on the database through the server.
-[]Handle user inputs and display data effectively.
-[]Support for real-time updates from the server.
-[]Offline capabilities with local data storage and synchronization with the server.
-[]Error handling and user feedback mechanisms.
-[]Multi-threading support for parallel processing tasks.

### Non-functional Requirements:

-[]Usability: Provide an intuitive user interface with minimal learning curve.
-[]Performance: Ensure responsiveness and smooth user experience.
-[]Compatibility: Support multiple devices and screen sizes.
-[]Security: Implement secure communication protocols and data encryption.
-[]Reliability: Minimize client-side crashes and errors.
-[]Resource Efficiency: Optimize memory and CPU usage.
-[]Scalability: Design the client to handle increasing data volumes and user loads.
-[]Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
